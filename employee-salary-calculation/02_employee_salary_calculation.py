We will use this script to teach Python to absolute beginners
The script is an example of salary  calculation implemented in Python
The salary calculator: 
    Net_Income = Gross_Income - Taxable_Due
    Taxable_Due = taxable_income + Social_security + Medicare_tax
    Taxable_Income = Gross_Income -120,00
    Social_security = 6.2% of Gross_Income
    Medicare_Tax = 1.45 % of Gross_Income
Federal tax brackets
10%	$0 to $9,525	
12%	$9,526 to $38,700	
22%	$38,701 to $82,500	
24%	$82,501 to $157,500	
32%	$157,501 to $200,000	
35%	$200,001 to $500,000	
37%	$500,001 or more
