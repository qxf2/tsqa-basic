""" We will use Python scripts for absolute beginners
 This script shows the use of BMR Calculator = Basal Metabolic Rate Calculator.
 BMR gives the value of the calories which the body intakes during weight gain or weight loss.
 The BMR Calculator:
    # Get the Age of the user
    # Get the Gender of the user
    # Get the weight(Kg/lb) of the user
    # Get the height(m/in") of the user
    # Calculate the BMI using the formula on the basis of gender, age, height and weight
       For Male: BMR= 88.362+(13.397*weight in kg/lb)+(4.799*height in cm/in")- (5.677*age in years)
       For Female: BMR = 447.593+(9.247*weight in kg/ib)+(3.098*height in cm/in")- (4.330*age in years)
       Also, this BMR calculator include features in Metric Units (kg,metre) & American Units (pound, inch)

Exercise 1: Calculate the BMR (in calorie)
Exercise 2: Check if the no. of days workout the user does:
            No. of Days       BMR *Value      Level of Intensity
                0-1             BMR*1.2         NO Exercise
                1-3            BMR*1.375       Light Exercise
                3-5            BMR*1.55       Moderate Exercise
              All Day          BMR*1.725       Heavy Exercise
Here there will be an implication of User-defined functions and Calling function along with if else statement.
