"""
We will use this script to learn Python to absolute beginners
The script is an example of BMI_Calculator implemented in Python
The BMI_Calculator: 
    # Get the weight(Kg) of the user
    # Get the height(m) of the user
    # Caculate the BMI using the formula
        BMI=weight in kg/height in meters*height in meters

Exercise 3:
        Write a program to calculate the BMI by accepting user input from the keyboard and check whether the user 
        comes in underweight ,normal weight or obesity. Create functions for calculating BMI and 
        check the user category.
            i)Get user weight in kg 
            ii)Get user height in meter
            iii) Use this formula to calculate the BMI
                    BMI = weight_of_the_user/(height_of_the_user * height_of_the_user)
            iv)Use this level to check user category
                #)Less than or equal to 18.5 is represents underweight
                #)Between 18.5 -24.9 indicate normal weight
                #)Between 25 -29.9 denotes over weight
                #)Greater than 30 denotes obese
        # Hint
            i)Create a function to get the input
            ii)Create one more function to calculate BMi
            iii)Create one more function for checking user category
